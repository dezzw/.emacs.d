(autoload 'posframe-workable-p "posframe" "\
Test posframe workable status.")
(autoload 'posframe-show "posframe" "\
Pop up a posframe to show STRING at POSITION.

 (1) POSITION

POSITION can be:
1. An integer, meaning point position.
2. A cons of two integers, meaning absolute X and Y coordinates.
3. Other type, in which case the corresponding POSHANDLER should be
   provided.

 (2) POSHANDLER

POSHANDLER is a function of one argument returning an actual
position.  Its argument is a plist of the following form:

  (:position xxx
   :poshandler xxx
   :font-height xxx
   :font-width xxx
   :posframe xxx
   :posframe-width xxx
   :posframe-height xxx
   :posframe-buffer xxx
   :parent-frame xxx
   :parent-window-start xxx
   :parent-window-end xxx
   :parent-window-left xxx
   :parent-window-top xxx
   :parent-frame-width xxx
   :parent-frame-height xxx
   :parent-window xxx
   :parent-window-width  xxx
   :parent-window-height xxx
   :mouse-x xxx
   ;mouse-y xxx
   :minibuffer-height xxx
   :mode-line-height  xxx
   :header-line-height xxx
   :tab-line-height xxx
   :x-pixel-offset xxx
   :y-pixel-offset xxx)

By default, poshandler is auto-selected based on the type of POSITION,
but the selection can be overridden using the POSHANDLER argument.

The builtin poshandler functions are listed below:

1.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-center'
2.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-top-center'
3.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-top-left-corner'
4.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-top-right-corner'
5.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-top-left-or-right-other-corner'
6.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-bottom-center'
7.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-bottom-left-corner'
8.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-bottom-right-corner'
9.  `posframe-poshandler-window-center'
10.  `posframe-poshandler-window-top-center'
11. `posframe-poshandler-window-top-left-corner'
12. `posframe-poshandler-window-top-right-corner'
13. `posframe-poshandler-window-bottom-center'
14. `posframe-poshandler-window-bottom-left-corner'
15. `posframe-poshandler-window-bottom-right-corner'
16. `posframe-poshandler-point-top-left-corner'
17. `posframe-poshandler-point-bottom-left-corner'
18. `posframe-poshandler-point-bottom-left-corner-upward'
19. `posframe-poshandler-point-window-center'
20. `posframe-poshandler-point-frame-center'

 (3) POSHANDLER-EXTRA-INFO

POSHANDLER-EXTRA-INFO is a plist, which will prepend to the
argument of poshandler function: `info', it will *OVERRIDE* the
exist key in `info'.

 (4) BUFFER-OR-NAME

This posframe's buffer is BUFFER-OR-NAME, which can be a buffer
or a name of a (possibly nonexistent) buffer.

buffer name can prefix with space, for example \" *mybuffer*\", so
the buffer name will hide for ibuffer and `list-buffers'.

 (5) NO-PROPERTIES

If NO-PROPERTIES is non-nil, The STRING's properties will
be removed before being shown in posframe.

 (6) HEIGHT, MAX-HEIGHT, MIN-HEIGHT, WIDTH, MAX-WIDTH and MIN-WIDTH

These arguments are specified in the canonical character width
and height of posframe, more details can be found in docstring of
function `fit-frame-to-buffer',

 (7) LEFT-FRINGE and RIGHT-FRINGE

If LEFT-FRINGE or RIGHT-FRINGE is a number, left fringe or
right fringe with be shown with the specified width.

 (8) BORDER-WIDTH, BORDER-COLOR, INTERNAL-BORDER-WIDTH and INTERNAL-BORDER-COLOR

By default, posframe shows no borders, but users can specify
borders by setting BORDER-WIDTH to a positive number.  Border
color can be specified by BORDER-COLOR.

INTERNAL-BORDER-WIDTH and INTERNAL-BORDER-COLOR are same as
BORDER-WIDTH and BORDER-COLOR, but do not suggest to use for the
reason:

   Add distinct controls for child frames' borders (Bug#45620)
   http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/commit/?id=ff7b1a133bfa7f2614650f8551824ffaef13fadc

 (9) FONT, FOREGROUND-COLOR and BACKGROUND-COLOR

Posframe's font as well as foreground and background colors are
derived from the current frame by default, but can be overridden
using the FONT, FOREGROUND-COLOR and BACKGROUND-COLOR arguments,
respectively.

 (10) CURSOR and WINDOW-POINT

By default, cursor is not showed in posframe, user can let cursor
showed with this argument help by set its value to a `cursor-type'.

When cursor need to be showed in posframe, user may need to set
WINDOW-POINT to the point of BUFFER, which can let cursor showed
at this point.

 (11) RESPECT-HEADER-LINE and RESPECT-MODE-LINE

By default, posframe will display no header-line, mode-line and
tab-line.  In case a header-line, mode-line or tab-line is
desired, users can set RESPECT-HEADER-LINE and RESPECT-MODE-LINE
to t.

 (12) INITIALIZE

INITIALIZE is a function with no argument.  It will run when
posframe buffer is first selected with `with-current-buffer'
in `posframe-show', and only run once (for performance reasons).

 (13) LINES-TRUNCATE

If LINES-TRUNCATE is non-nil, then lines will truncate in the
posframe instead of wrap.

 (14) OVERRIDE-PARAMETERS

OVERRIDE-PARAMETERS is very powful, *all* the valid frame parameters
used by posframe's frame can be overridden by it.

NOTE: some `posframe-show' arguments are not frame parameters, so they
can not be overrided by this argument.

 (15) TIMEOUT

TIMEOUT can specify the number of seconds after which the posframe
will auto-hide.

 (15) REFRESH

If REFRESH is a number, posframe's frame-size will be re-adjusted
every REFRESH seconds.

 (17) ACCEPT-FOCUS

When ACCEPT-FOCUS is non-nil, posframe will accept focus.
be careful, you may face some bugs when set it to non-nil.

 (18) HIDEHANDLER

HIDEHANDLER is a function, when it return t, posframe will be
hide, this function has a plist argument:

  (:posframe-buffer xxx
   :posframe-parent-buffer xxx)

The builtin hidehandler functions are listed below:

1. `posframe-hidehandler-when-buffer-switch'

 (19) REFPOSHANDLER

REFPOSHANDLER is a function, a reference position (most is
top-left of current frame) will be returned when call this
function.

when it is nil or it return nil, child-frame feature will be used
and reference position will be deal with in Emacs.

The user case I know at the moment is let ivy-posframe work well
in EXWM environment (let posframe show on the other application
window).

         DO NOT USE UNLESS NECESSARY!!!

An example parent frame poshandler function is:

1. `posframe-refposhandler-xwininfo'

 (19) Others

You can use `posframe-delete-all' to delete all posframes.

Isearch mode for PDF buffer.

When this mode is enabled \\[isearch-forward], among other keys,
starts an incremental search in this PDF document.  Since this mode
uses external programs to highlight found matches via
image-processing, proceeding to the next match may be slow.

Therefore two isearch behaviours have been defined: Normal isearch and
batch mode.  The later one is a minor mode
(`pdf-isearch-batch-mode'), which when activated inhibits isearch
from stopping at and highlighting every single match, but rather
display them batch-wise.  Here a batch means a number of matches
currently visible in the selected window.

The kind of highlighting is determined by three faces
`pdf-isearch-match' (for the current match), `pdf-isearch-lazy'
(for all other matches) and `pdf-isearch-batch' (when in batch
mode), which see.

Colors may also be influenced by the minor-mode
`pdf-view-dark-minor-mode'.  If this is minor mode enabled, each face's
dark colors, are used (see e.g. `frame-background-mode'), instead

(autoload 'reformatter-define "reformatter" "\
Define a reformatter command with NAME.

When called, the reformatter will use PROGRAM and any ARGS to
reformat the current buffer.  The contents of the buffer will be
passed as standard input to the reformatter, which should output
them to standard output.  A nonzero exit code will be reported as
failure, and the output of the command to standard error will be
displayed to the user.

The macro accepts the following keyword arguments:

PROGRAM (required)

  Provides a form which should evaluate to a string at runtime,
  e.g. a literal string, or the name of a variable which holds
  the program path.

ARGS

  Command-line arguments for the program.  If provided, this is a
  form which evaluates to a list of strings at runtime.  Default
  is the empty list.  This form is evaluated at runtime so that
  you can use buffer-local variables to influence the args passed
  to the reformatter program: the variable `input-file' will be
  lexically bound to the path of a file containing the text to be
  reformatted: see the keyword options INPUT-FILE, STDIN and
  STDOUT for more information.

STDIN

  When non-nil (the default), the program is passed the input
  data on stdin.  Set this to nil when your reformatter can only
  operate on files in place.  In such a case, your ARGS should
  include a reference to the `input-file' variable, which will be
  bound to an input path when evaluated.

STDOUT

  When non-nil (the default), the program is expected to write
  the reformatted text to stdout.  Set this to nil if your
  reformatter can only operate on files in place, in which case
  the contents of the temporary input file will be used as the
  replacement text.

INPUT-FILE

  Sometimes your reformatter program might expect files to be in
  a certain directory or have a certain file extension.  This option
  lets you handle that.

  If provided, it is a form which will be evaluated before each
  run of the formatter, and is expected to return a temporary
  file path suitable for holding the region to be reformatted.
  It must not produce the same path as the current buffer's file
  if that is set: you shouldn't be operating directly on the
  buffer's backing file.  The temporary input file will be
  deleted automatically.  You might find the functions
  `reformatter-temp-file-in-current-directory' and
  `reformatter-temp-file' helpful.

MODE

  Unless nil, also generate a minor mode that will call the
  reformatter command from `before-save-hook' when enabled.
  Default is t.

GROUP

  If provided, this is the custom group used for any generated
  modes or custom variables.  Don't forget to declare this group
  using a `defgroup' form.

LIGHTER

  If provided, this is a mode lighter string which will be used
  for the \"-on-save\" minor mode.  It should have a leading
  space.  The supplied value will be used as the default for a
  generated custom variable which specifies the mode lighter.
  Default is nil, ie. no lighter.

KEYMAP

  If provided, this is the symbol name of the \"-on-save\" mode's
  keymap, which you must declare yourself.  Default is no keymap.

EXIT-CODE-SUCCESS-P

  If provided, this is a function object callable with `funcall'
  which accepts an integer process exit code, and returns non-nil
  if that exit code is considered successful.  This could be a
  lambda, quoted symbol or sharp-quoted symbol.  If not supplied,
  the code is considered successful if it is `zerop'.

Create a Hydra - a family of functions with prefix NAME.

NAME should be a symbol, it will be the prefix of all functions
defined here.

BODY has the format:

    (BODY-MAP BODY-KEY &rest BODY-PLIST)

DOCSTRING will be displayed in the echo area to identify the
Hydra.  When DOCSTRING starts with a newline, special Ruby-style
substitution will be performed by `hydra--format'.

Functions are created on basis of HEADS, each of which has the
format:

    (KEY CMD &optional HINT &rest PLIST)

BODY-MAP is a keymap; `global-map' is used quite often.  Each
function generated from HEADS will be bound in BODY-MAP to
BODY-KEY + KEY (both are strings passed to `kbd'), and will set
the transient map so that all following heads can be called
though KEY only.  BODY-KEY can be an empty string.

CMD is a callable expression: either an interactive function
name, or an interactive lambda, or a single sexp (it will be
wrapped in an interactive lambda).

HINT is a short string that identifies its head.  It will be
printed beside KEY in the echo erea if `hydra-is-helpful' is not
nil.  If you don't even want the KEY to be printed, set HINT
explicitly to nil.

The heads inherit their PLIST from BODY-PLIST and are allowed to
override some keys.  The keys recognized are :exit, :bind, and :column.
:exit can be:

- nil (default): this head will continue the Hydra state.
- t: this head will stop the Hydra state.

:bind can be:
- nil: this head will not be bound in BODY-MAP.
- a lambda taking KEY and CMD used to bind a head.

:column is a string that sets the column for all subsequent heads.

It is possible to omit both BODY-MAP and BODY-KEY if you don't
want to bind anything.  In that case, typically you will bind the
generated NAME/body command.  This command is also the return
result of `defhydra'.

==================== ========================================================


* Callback functions

Callback functions STATUS, ERROR, COMPLETE and `cdr\\='s in element of
the alist STATUS-CODE take same keyword arguments listed below.  For
forward compatibility, these functions must ignore unused keyword
arguments (i.e., it\\='s better to use `&allow-other-keys\\=' [#]_).::

    (CALLBACK                      ; SUCCESS/ERROR/COMPLETE/STATUS-CODE
     :data          data           ; whatever PARSER function returns, or nil
     :error-thrown  error-thrown   ; (ERROR-SYMBOL . DATA), or nil
     :symbol-status symbol-status  ; success/error/timeout/abort/parse-error
     :response      response       ; request-response object
     ...)

.. [#] `&allow-other-keys\\=' is a special \"markers\" available in macros
   in the CL library for function definition such as `cl-defun\\=' and
   `cl-function\\='.  Without this marker, you need to specify all arguments
   to be passed.  This becomes problem when request.el adds new arguments
   when calling callback functions.  If you use `&allow-other-keys\\='
   (or manually ignore other arguments), your code is free from this
   problem.  See info node `(cl) Argument Lists\\=' for more information.

Arguments data, error-thrown, symbol-status can be accessed by
`request-response-data\\=', `request-response-error-thrown\\=',
`request-response-symbol-status\\=' accessors, i.e.::

    (request-response-data RESPONSE)  ; same as data

Response object holds other information which can be accessed by
the following accessors:
`request-response-status-code\\=',
`request-response-url\\=' and
`request-response-settings\\='

* STATUS-CODE callback

STATUS-CODE is an alist of the following format::

    ((N-1 . CALLBACK-1)
     (N-2 . CALLBACK-2)
     ...)

Here, N-1, N-2,... are integer status codes such as 200.


* FILES

FILES is an alist of the following format::

    ((NAME-1 . FILE-1)
     (NAME-2 . FILE-2)
     ...)

where FILE-N is a list of the form::

    (FILENAME &key PATH BUFFER STRING MIME-TYPE)

FILE-N can also be a string (path to the file) or a buffer object.
In that case, FILENAME is set to the file name or buffer name.

Example FILES argument::

    `((\"passwd\"   . \"/etc/passwd\")                ; filename = passwd
      (\"scratch\"  . ,(get-buffer \"*scratch*\"))    ; filename = *scratch*
      (\"passwd2\"  . (\"password.txt\" :file \"/etc/passwd\"))
      (\"scratch2\" . (\"scratch.txt\"  :buffer ,(get-buffer \"*scratch*\")))
      (\"data\"     . (\"data.csv\"     :data \"1,2,3\\n4,5,6\\n\")))

.. note:: FILES is implemented only for curl backend for now.
   As furl.el_ supports multipart POST, it should be possible to
   support FILES in pure elisp by making furl.el_ another backend.
   Contributions are welcome.

   .. _furl.el: https://code.google.com/p/furl-el/


* PARSER function

PARSER function takes no argument and it is executed in the
buffer with HTTP response body.  The current position in the HTTP
response buffer is at the beginning of the buffer.  As the HTTP
header is stripped off, the cursor is actually at the beginning
of the response body.  So, for example, you can pass `json-read\\='
to parse JSON object in the buffer.  To fetch whole response as a
string, pass `buffer-string\\='.

When using `json-read\\=', it is useful to know that the returned
type can be modified by `json-object-type\\=', `json-array-type\\=',
`json-key-type\\=', `json-false\\=' and `json-null\\='.  See docstring of
each function for what it does.  For example, to convert JSON
objects to plist instead of alist, wrap `json-read\\=' by `lambda\\='
like this.::

    (request
     \"https://...\"
     :parser (lambda ()
               (let ((json-object-type \\='plist))
                 (json-read)))
     ...)

This is analogous to the `dataType\\=' argument of jQuery.ajax_.
Only this function can access to the process buffer, which
is killed immediately after the execution of this function.

* SYNC

Synchronous request is functional, but *please* don\\='t use it
other than testing or debugging.  Emacs users have better things
to do rather than waiting for HTTP request.  If you want a better
way to write callback chains, use `request-deferred\\='.

If you can\\='t avoid using it (e.g., you are inside of some hook
which must return some value), make sure to set TIMEOUT to
relatively small value.

Due to limitation of `url-retrieve-synchronously\\=', response slots
`request-response-error-thrown\\=', `request-response-history\\=' and
`request-response-url\\=' are unknown (always nil) when using
synchronous request with `url-retrieve\\=' backend.

* Note

API of `request\\=' is somewhat mixture of jQuery.ajax_ (Javascript)
and requests.request_ (Python).

BODY is the same as that in `defhydra', withe the following
pretty hydra specific ones:

  - `:separator' a single char used to generate the separator

  - `:title' a string that's added to the beginning of the

  - `:formatter' a function that takes the generated docstring

    When specified, invisible head(s) are created with the

HEADS-PLIST is a plist of columns of hydra heads.  The keys of

(autoload 'define-polymode "polymode" "\
Define a new polymode MODE.
This macro defines command MODE and an indicator variable MODE
which becomes t when MODE is active and nil otherwise.

MODE command can be used as both major and minor mode. Using
polymodes as minor modes makes sense when :hostmode (see below)
is not specified, in which case polymode installs only inner
modes and doesn't touch current major mode.

Standard hook MODE-hook is run at the end of the initialization
of each polymode buffer (both indirect and base buffers).

This macro also defines the MODE-map keymap from the :keymap
argument and PARENT-map (see below) and poly-[MODE-NAME]-polymode
variable which holds an object of class `pm-polymode' which holds
the entire configuration for this polymode.

PARENT is either the polymode configuration object or a polymode
mode (there is 1-to-1 correspondence between config
objects (`pm-polymode') and mode functions). The new polymode
MODE inherits alll the behavior from PARENT except for the
overwrites specified by the keywords (see below). The new MODE
runs all the hooks from the PARENT-mode and inherits its MODE-map
from PARENT-map.

DOC is an optional documentation string. If present PARENT must
be provided, but can be nil.

BODY is executed after the complete initialization of the
polymode but before MODE-hook. It is executed once for each
polymode buffer - host buffer on initialization and every inner
buffer subsequently created.

Before the BODY code keyword arguments (i.e. alternating keywords
and values) are allowed. The following special keywords
controlling the behavior of the new MODE are supported:

:lighter Optional LIGHTER is displayed in the mode line when the
   mode is on. If omitted, it defaults to the :lighter slot of
   CONFIG object.

:keymap If nil, a new MODE-map keymap is created what directly
  inherits from the PARENT's keymap. The last keymap in the
  inheritance chain is always `polymode-minor-mode-map'. If a
  keymap it is used directly as it is. If a list of binding of
  the form (KEY . BINDING) it is merged the bindings are added to
  the newly create keymap.

:after-hook A single form which is evaluated after the mode hooks
  have been run. It should not be quoted.

Other keywords are added to the `pm-polymode' configuration
object and should be valid slots in PARENT config object or the
root config `pm-polymode' object if PARENT is nil. By far the
most frequently used slots are:

:hostmode Symbol pointing to a `pm-host-chunkmode' object
  specifying the behavior of the hostmode. If missing or nil,
  MODE will behave as a minor-mode in the sense that it will
  reuse the currently installed major mode and will install only
  the inner modes.

  objects which specify the behavior of inner modes (or submodes).

       ;; What to do in the child process
       (lambda ()
         (message \"This is a test\")
         (sleep-for 3)
         222)

       ;; What to do when it finishes
       (lambda (result)
         (message \"Async process done, result should be 222: %s\"
                  result)))

If you call `async-send' from a child process, the message will
be also passed to the FINISH-FUNC.  You can test RESULT to see if
it is a message by using `async-message-p'.  If nil, it means
this is the final result.  Example of the FINISH-FUNC:

    (lambda (result)
      (if (async-message-p result)
          (message \"Received a message from child process: %s\" result)
        (message \"Async process done, result: %s\" result)))

If FINISH-FUNC is nil or missing, a future is returned that can
be inspected using `async-get', blocking until the value is
ready.  Example:

    (let ((proc (async-start
                   ;; What to do in the child process
                   (lambda ()
                     (message \"This is a test\")
                     (sleep-for 3)
                     222))))

        (message \"I'm going to do some work here\") ;; ....

        (message \"Waiting on async process, result should be 222: %s\"
                 (async-get proc)))

If you don't want to use a callback, and you don't care about any
return value from the child process, pass the `ignore' symbol as
the second argument (if you don't, and never call `async-get', it
will leave *emacs* process buffers hanging around):

    (async-start
     (lambda ()
       (delete-file \"a remote file on a slow link\" nil))
     \\='ignore)

Special case:
If the output of START-FUNC is a string with properties
e.g. (buffer-string) RESULT will be transformed in a list where the
car is the string itself (without props) and the cdr the rest of
properties, this allows using in FINISH-FUNC the string without
properties and then apply the properties in cdr to this string (if
needed).
Properties handling special objects like markers are returned as
list to allow restoring them later.
See <https://github.com/jwiegley/emacs-async/issues/145> for more infos.

Note: Even when FINISH-FUNC is present, a future is still
returned except that it yields no value (since the value is
passed to FINISH-FUNC).  Call `async-get' on such a future always
returns nil.  It can still be useful, however, as an argument to
`async-ready' or `async-wait'.

check whether (meow-NAME-SYM-mode) is true.

Example usage:
(meow-define-state mystate
  \"My meow state\"
  :lighter \" [M]\"
  :keymap 'my-keymap
  (message \"toggled state\"))

Also see meow-register-state, which is used internally by this
function, if you want more control over defining your state. This
is more helpful if you already have a keymap and defined minor
mode that you only need to integrate with meow.

This function produces several items:
1. meow-NAME-mode: a minor mode for the state. This is the main entry point.
2. meow-NAME-mode-p: a predicate for whether the state is active.
3. meow-cursor-type-NAME: a variable for the cursor type for the state.
4. meow--update-cursor-NAME: a function that sets the cursor type to 3.
 and face FACE or 'meow-unknown cursor if FACE is nil.

Which set of key bindings to add to the global keymap, if any.

This option controls which set of Magit key bindings, if any, may
be added to the global keymap, even before Magit is first used in
the current Emacs session.

If the value is nil, no bindings are added.

If `default', maybe add:

    C-x g     `magit-status'
    C-x M-g   `magit-dispatch'
    C-c M-g   `magit-file-dispatch'

If `recommended', maybe add:

    C-x g     `magit-status'
    C-c g     `magit-dispatch'
    C-c f     `magit-file-dispatch'

    These bindings are strongly recommended, but we cannot use
    them by default, because the \"C-c <LETTER>\" namespace is
    strictly reserved for bindings added by the user.

The bindings in the chosen set may be added when
`after-init-hook' is run.  Each binding is added if, and only
if, at that time no other key is bound to the same command,
and no other command is bound to the same key.  In other words
we try to avoid adding bindings that are unnecessary, as well
as bindings that conflict with other bindings.

Adding these bindings is delayed until `after-init-hook' is
run to allow users to set the variable anywhere in their init
file (without having to make sure to do so before `magit' is
loaded or autoloaded) and to increase the likelihood that all
the potentially conflicting user bindings have already been
added.

To set this variable use either `setq' or the Custom interface.
Do not use the function `customize-set-variable' because doing
that would cause Magit to be loaded immediately, when that form
is evaluated (this differs from `custom-set-variables', which
doesn't load the libraries that define the customized variables).

See also info node `(haskell-mode)haskell-decl-scan-mode' for
more details about this minor mode.

Top-level declarations are scanned and listed in the menu item
\"Declarations\" (if enabled via option
`haskell-decl-scan-add-to-menubar').  Selecting an item from this
menu will take point to the start of the declaration.

\\[beginning-of-defun] and \\[end-of-defun] move forward and backward to the start of a declaration.

This may link with `haskell-doc-mode'.

For non-literate and LaTeX-style literate scripts, we assume the
common convention that top-level declarations start at the first
column.  For Bird-style literate scripts, we assume the common
convention that top-level declarations start at the third column,
ie. after \"> \".

Anything in `font-lock-comment-face' is not considered for a
declaration.  Therefore, using Haskell font locking with comments
coloured in `font-lock-comment-face' improves declaration scanning.

Literate Haskell scripts are supported: If the value of
`haskell-literate' (set automatically by `haskell-literate-mode')
is `bird', a Bird-style literate script is assumed.  If it is nil
or `tex', a non-literate or LaTeX-style literate script is
assumed, respectively.

Literate Haskell scripts are supported via `haskell-literate-mode'.
The variable `haskell-literate' indicates the style of the script in the
current buffer.  See the documentation on this variable for more details.

Use `haskell-version' to find out what version of Haskell mode you are
currently using.

Additional Haskell mode modules can be hooked in via `haskell-mode-hook'.

Indentation modes:

    `haskell-indentation-mode', Kristof Bastiaensen, Gergely Risko
      Intelligent semi-automatic indentation Mk2

    `haskell-indent-mode', Guy Lapalme
      Intelligent semi-automatic indentation.

Interaction modes:

    `interactive-haskell-mode'
      Interact with per-project GHCi processes through a REPL and
      directory-aware sessions.

Other modes:

    `haskell-decl-scan-mode', Graeme E Moss
      Scans top-level declarations, and places them in a menu.

    `haskell-doc-mode', Hans-Wolfgang Loidl
      Sets up eldoc to echo types of functions or syntax of keywords
      when the cursor is idle.

To activate a minor-mode, simply run the interactive command. For
example, `M-x haskell-doc-mode'. Run it again to disable it.

To enable a mode for every `haskell-mode' buffer, add a hook in
your Emacs configuration. To do that you can customize
`haskell-mode-hook' or add lines to your .emacs file. For
example, to enable `interactive-haskell-mode', use the following:

    (add-hook \\='haskell-mode-hook \\='interactive-haskell-mode)

- `smerge-mode': show and work with diff3 conflict markers used

Search with `grep' for files in DIR where the content matches a regexp.

The initial input is given by the INITIAL argument.  DIR can be
nil, a directory string or a list of file/directory paths.  If
`consult-grep' is called interactively with a prefix argument,
the user can specify the directories or files to search in.
Multiple directories must be separated by comma in the
minibuffer, since they are read via `completing-read-multiple'.
By default the project directory is used if
`consult-project-function' is defined and returns non-nil.
Otherwise the `default-directory' is searched.

The input string is split, the first part of the string (grep
input) is passed to the asynchronous grep process and the second
part of the string is passed to the completion-style filtering.

The input string is split at a punctuation character, which is
given as the first character of the input string.  The format is
similar to Perl-style regular expressions, e.g., /regexp/.
Furthermore command line options can be passed to grep, specified
behind --.  The overall prompt input has the form
`#async-input -- grep-opts#filter-string'.

Note that the grep input string is transformed from Emacs regular
expressions to Posix regular expressions.  Always enter Emacs
regular expressions at the prompt.  `consult-grep' behaves like
builtin Emacs search commands, e.g., Isearch, which take Emacs
regular expressions.  Furthermore the asynchronous input split
into words, each word must match separately and in any order.
See `consult--regexp-compiler' for the inner workings.  In order
to disable transformations of the grep input, adjust
`consult--regexp-compiler' accordingly.

Here we give a few example inputs:

#alpha beta         : Search for alpha and beta in any order.
#alpha.*beta        : Search for alpha before beta.
#\\(alpha\\|beta\\) : Search for alpha or beta (Note Emacs syntax!)
#word -- -C3        : Search for word, include 3 lines as context
#first#second       : Search for first, quick filter for second.

Minor mode for editing scientific LaTeX documents.

                           KEYWORD COMMANDS
                           ----------------

Many CDLaTeX commands are activated with an abbrev-like
mechanism.  When a keyword is typed followed \\[cdlatex-tab], the
keyword is deleted from the buffer and a command is executed.
You can get a full list of these commands with
\\[cdlatex-command-help].  For example, when you type `fr<TAB>',
CDLaTeX will insert \\frac{}{}.

When inserting templates like \\='\\frac{}{}\\=', the cursor is
positioned properly.  Use \\[cdlatex-tab] to move through
templates.  \\[cdlatex-tab] also kills unnecessary braces around
subscripts and superscripts at point.

                     MATH CHARACTERS AND ACCENTS
                     ---------------------------

\\[cdlatex-math-symbol] followed by any character inserts a LaTeX
math character
      e.g. \\[cdlatex-math-symbol]e
        => \\epsilon

\\[cdlatex-math-symbol]\\[cdlatex-math-symbol] followed by any
character inserts other LaTeX math character
      e.g. \\[cdlatex-math-symbol]\\[cdlatex-math-symbol]e
        => \\varepsilon
\\[cdlatex-math-modify]  followed by character puts a math
accent on a letter or symbol
      e.g. \\[cdlatex-math-symbol]a\\[cdlatex-math-modify]~
        => \\tilde{\\alpha}

CDLaTeX is aware of the math environments in LaTeX and modifies
the workings of some functions according to the current status.

                             ONLINE HELP
                             -----------

After pressing \\[cdlatex-math-symbol] or
\\[cdlatex-math-modify], CDLaTeX waits for a short time for the
second character.  If that does not come, it will pop up a window
displaying the available characters and their meanings.

the mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.

insertation in LaTeX math. For example typing x 1 2 will insert

To turn cdlatex-electricindex Minor Mode on and off in a
particular buffer, use `M-x cdlatex-electricindex-mode'.

To turn on cdlatex-electricindex Minor Mode for all LaTeX files,
add one of the following lines to your .emacs file:

    (add-hook 'latex-mode-hook #'turn-on-cdlatex-electricindex)

This index insertion will only work when the cursor is in a LaTeX
math environment, based on (texmathp). If texmathp is not

`cdlatex-electricindex-mode-hook'.
